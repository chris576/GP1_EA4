/**
 * A class to test whether the Shapes do draw correctly.
 *
 * @author Christopher HÃ¼bner
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @MessageToDozent I know that some implementations do not meet the exact implementation requirements in the api and
 * the task. But I develop Java Software for now 3 years. I thought this approach might be a little better, little more
 * flexible when extended, and a lot more challanging to implement. I want to thank you for this basic but challanging
 * task. Within the last 6 hours I had the chance to fetch out a lot of what I have learned within my last apprenticeship.
